# Diamond Pattern Generator

This Java program generates a diamond pattern using asterisks based on the user's input.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `Main.java` file.
2. Compile the `Main.java` file using a Java compiler.
3. Run the compiled program.
4. Enter a number when prompted to specify the size of the diamond pattern.

## How it Works

The program prompts the user to enter a number, which determines the size of the diamond pattern.

- The first loop generates the upper part of the diamond pattern.
- The second loop generates the lower part of the diamond pattern, which is essentially the inverted triangle.

Each loop iterates over the rows of the diamond, adjusting the number of spaces and asterisks accordingly to create the desired pattern.

## Example

Suppose the user enters `3`:
